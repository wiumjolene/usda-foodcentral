The data in Experimental Foods may include (or link to) variables such as genetics, environmental inputs and outputs, supply chains, economic considerations, and nutrition research. These data will allow users to examine a range of factors used that may affect the profiles of food components, including nutrients and resulting dietary intakes as well as the sustainability of agricultural and dietary food systems."
