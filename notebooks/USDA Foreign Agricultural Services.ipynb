    "1. Export (domestic) include (1) commodities which are grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States and (2) commodities of foreign origin which have undergone substantial transformation in the United States from the form in which they were imported.\n",
    "2. Import (consumption) measures the total value of the end-use product that physically clears Customs, or goods withdrawn from Customs bonded warehouses or U.S. Foreign Trade Zones, which immediately enter consumption channels.\n",
    "3. Import (general) measures the total value of merchandise shipments that arrive in the U.S. from foreign countries, whether such merchandise enters consumption channels immediately or is entered into bonded warehouses and later transshipped or Foreign Trade Zones under Customs custody.\n",
    "4. Re-exports consist of commodities of foreign origin which (1) have entered the United States for consumption, into Customs bonded warehouses, or U.S. Foreign Trade Zones and (2) at the time of exportation are in the same condition as when imported.\n",

    "*The international Harmonized System (HS) is administered by the World Customs Organization and serves as the foundation for the import and export classification systems used in the United States. The U.S. import classification system, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) administered by the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the U.S. export classification system, the Schedule B administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Division, both rely on the international HS codes for their 4- and 6-digit headings and subheadings.*\n",

    "1. BICO (HS6) is a variation of the \"BICO (HS10)\", but at the 6-digit level, which can be used to compare aggregates across different country reporters with either UN or TDM data. It can also be used to compare exports and imports using the same aggregate definitions.\n",
    "1. FAS provides additional query options with more detailed commodity aggregates using 10-digit level codes (including breakouts for specific grains, oilseeds, livestock products, and more).\n",
    "1. FAS Legacy Group is based on USDA's definition of traded agricultural products at the 10-digit level prior to the adoption of the WTO agricultural definition.\n",
    "1. FATUS the Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States (FATUS) is a system of 211 trade aggregates created by the Economic Research Service summarizing U.S. agricultural trade. Similar to the FAS product group, this group provides an additional selection of detailed aggregates based on 10-digit level codes (including breakouts for specific fruits and vegetables).\n",

    "1. Harmonized (HS-10) allows users to select commodities at the 10-digit level based on the U.S. Census Schedule B codes for exports, and the U.S. International Trade Commission USHTS codes for imports.\n",
    "1. Organics - Selected lists organic aggregates, including organic lemons, pears, and tomatoes.\n",
    "1. Processed Food* lists processed product aggregates, including baby food, chocolates, and prepared/preserved meats.\n",
